# EngiLearn

This repository contains the code for optimization and machine learning algorithms for engineering design problems. Our goal here is to provide clean example usage of EngiBench and provide strong baselines for future comparisons.

## Coding Philosophy
As much as we can, we follow the [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) philosophy: single-file, high-quality implementations.
